### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up:
Download NEOS_lib and NEOS_Simple.java file
* Configuration: 
The various of type(e.g. lp, milp, nco), solver(e.g. Gurobi, MOSEK), and input(e.g. AMPL, Gurobi) can be set as you want. 
The gms is modelling formulation file. Here we use GAMS format. The gdx is an external input. 
* How to run tests:
Use command line and set classpath as the files of NEOS_lib. Then compiler!
The result you can see first is job info. It returns result and shows till runs over.
